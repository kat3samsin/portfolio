My interest in coding sparked in high school where I learned to create random shapes using Turbo Pascal. I took CS at Mapua University back in 2002 and graduated in 2005, shortly after I had my first job as a Java Developer. 

Currently, I am a Software Engineering Manager at Oracle NetSuite, before becoming a manager I was a Software Architect. As an architect, I designed and built Tax Reporting Framework in NetSuite. This enabled NetSuite teams and Partners worldwide to quickly develop and deploy localized tax reports to NetSuite customers. As a manager, I develop and mentor engineers to make sure they are happy, properly motivated, and constantly challenged at work and in life. I lead JAPAC teams to deliver on-time, compliant, and localized tax solutions to NetSuite customers. I constantly collaborate with teams worldwide to add features and improve development experience using Tax Reporting framework.
