My interest in coding sparked in high school where I learned to create random shapes using Turbo Pascal. I took CS in Mapua University back in 2002 and graduated 2005, shortly after I had my first job as a Java Developer. Currently, I am a Principal Software Engineer at Oracle NetSuite that designs and build SuiteApps from the ground-up.
