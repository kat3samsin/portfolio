My interest in coding sparked in high school where I learned to create random shapes using Turbo Pascal. I took CS in Mapua University back in 2002 and graduated 2005, shortly after i had my first job as a Java Developer. Currently, I am a Principal Software Engineer at Oracle NetSuite that designs and build SuiteApps from the ground-up.

I have a full spectrum of interests, I'm an 👩🏻‍🎨, musician, bookworm, horologist, trader, coffee connoisseur, audiophile and recently a mom to a beautiful and very active baby boy. i like all things beautiful. i enjoy recording memories by journalling. i love the smell of books, listening to lossless music, and making damn good coffee. i am *highly motivated* and passionate about *continuous learning* and development.
