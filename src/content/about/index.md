i'm katrina or katre, *web developer* based in manila. my interest in coding started in high school where i learned my first programming language was turbo pascal. i took computer science in mapua university back in 2002, graduated 2005 and had my first job as a java developer. now i am platform software engineer who develops both backend and frontend at oracle netsuite.

i have a full spectrum of interests. i'm an artist, musician, horologist, trader, coffee connoisseur, audiophile and recently a mom to a beautiful and very active baby boy. i like all things beautiful. i enjoy recording memories by journalling. i love the smell of books, listening to lossless music, and making damn good coffee. i am highly motivated and passionate about continuous learning and development.
